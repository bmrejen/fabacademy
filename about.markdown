**Me**


My name is Ben. I was born in France and grew up in Saint Lucia, a small island in the Caribbean.
I graduated from a business school in Lyon, France and worked in IT management in France, Russia, Canada and Japan.

**Career**


3 years ago, I decided to make the jump and decided to become a web developer. I took classes at Le Wagon and got my first job as a coder.
Now I am on my way to code hard stuff and build my own robots.

**Final project**


For my final product, I would like to build a device that improves the life of mothers, handicapped people or animals.

**Special thanks**


I initially started the Fab Academy in Shanghai. But because of the coronavirus outbreak, I had to leave the country. Jonah and Romain were super kind and let me use the Fab Academy Digiscope. So I am now studying there. 
Thank you so much to both of you!


**Code inspection**


I program under close inspection by Molière, my code quality inspector who jumped on my scooter at a red light one evening and wouldn't go away.

**My setup**


This website was made with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), a static website generator based on Ruby.

It runs with this beautiful and simplistic theme called [Hydejack](https://hydejack.com)

The whole project runs inside a Docker container built from the [jekyll/jekyll](https://hub.docker.com/r/jekyll/jekyll/) image

I build manually before each push. I'll set up a pre-push hook when I have time.
