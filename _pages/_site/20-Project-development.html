<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>

<p>My friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamshidkohandel/">Jamshid Kohandel</a> works for the French government as a special advisor for digital transformation. He also happens to be 100% blind.</p>

<p>A big issue he faces is that when he goes to a social gathering with lots of people that he knows, he has no way to know who is standing around him. As a result, he cannot approach his friends or acquaintances; he has to wait for them to approach him.</p>

<p>This is pretty upsetting because that means he has little control over his social interactions and has to remain totally passive while people around him are having fun.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>We are going to tackle this problem with some <strong>Face-recognition glasses</strong></p>

<p>Hopefully, these glasses will gather a lot of functions. We are probably going to have to abandon a few of them to finish this project in time, but theoretically, we want our glasses to be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>scan the environment in front of him</li>
  <li>compare them to a database of known faces in a SD card</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If the person is already in the database</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>the glasses will say the name of this person out loud through a built-in speaker</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If this person is unknown</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>the speaker will give some indications, like “female, around 40, Asian, police uniform”</li>
  <li>Jamshid can populate his database of known faces by standing in front of them and pressing a button and saying their name</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="future-improvements">Future improvements</h2>

<p>If we are able to complete this task, we also want to add some features that will improve the lives of blind people around the world:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the glasses can recognize elements of the environment and say things like “car, dog, door, stairs, stop sign”</li>
  <li>we can add a distance measurement and have the speaker speak LOUDER for close people or objects</li>
  <li>we can add 4 speakers on the glasses so the sound comes from the position of the item</li>
  <li>we can add hole-trackers. Blind people can already detect obstacles with their traditional or AI-canes but it’s very hard for them to detect holes. As a result, it’s easy for them to fall into a lake or a manhole cover.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-we-will-need">What we will need</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Raspberry Pi that is not too big and has enough computing power
Arduino is too slow, Jetson Nano is not portable. We will use a Banana Pi M2 Zero OR a Pi Zero W OR a Pi Model A+</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ESP-EYE with built-in microphone</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>speakers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>battery holder</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>probably a relay</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>probably a buck converter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>battery</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>battery holder</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>FTDI programmer</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We install a board manager in the Arduino IDE</p>

<p>and uncomment the line <code class="highlighter-rouge">#define CAMERA_MODEL_AI_THINKER</code>
and add</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>const char* ssid = "my_wifi_network";
const char* password = "my_wifi_password";
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The cam now offers a server</p>

<p>When using face recognition, we use CIF detection</p>

<p>The rough sketch will look something like this</p>
<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1NtTdS63znI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>We print it with our Alfawise U30 Pro</p>

<p>Settings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PLA</li>
  <li>Nozzle: 0.4 mm</li>
  <li>Heatbed: 160°</li>
  <li>Nozzle temp: 205°</li>
</ul>

<p>Result: we have something to start with</p>
