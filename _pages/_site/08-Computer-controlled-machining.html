<p><strong>Assignment</strong>: test runout, alignment, speeds, feeds, and toolpaths for your machine</p>

<p>Today we are working with a CNC. The first program we use is <strong>VCarve Pro</strong></p>

<p>We fill first try to use styrofoam and cut a 3-centimeter layer from the top.</p>

<p>We enter the length and width of our block

<p>We choose a cut depth of 2 mm

<p>We should have the block that we created visible in 3D

<p>We can see the path the mill is going to take by clicking <em>Reset Toolpath</em> and <em>Preview Toolpath</em>

<p>When we are done, we have 2 files to save:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a <strong>.sbp</strong> file for the toolpath</li>
  <li>a <strong>.crv</strong> file as a general save with all features</li>
</ul>

<p>We are now ready to send the job to the milling program</p>

<h2 id="running-the-job">Running the job</h2>

<p>We will use <strong>Shopbot</strong> to do the milling</p>

<p>Stick base pane so it doesn’t fly off.

<p>Choose the good flute for the material we are going to mill and measure it

<p>We stick it inside the machine with 2 wrenches. We do not go too hard on then

<p>Choose rpm on the machine. It ranges 0-300, with 300 corresponding to 18,000 rpm.
In our case we choose 167, which matches 10,000 rpm.

<p>We open the file with the program.

<p>We chose a z-zero at the top of the plane by clicking <em>Move Tool</em>. On our program, we have to click it twice.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/08-07-dimension08.jpg" alt="alt text" title="dimension08" /></p>

<p>We move the mill to the zero we want.
<img src="/assets/images/08-08-dimension09.jpg" alt="alt text" title="dimension09" /></p>

<p>When we are done, we click the <em>Zero Axes</em>
<img src="/assets/images/08-09-dimension10.jpg" alt="alt text" title="dimension10" /></p>

<p>When we are done, we click Start
<img src="/assets/images/08-10-dimension13.jpg" alt="alt text" title="dimension13" /></p>

<p>We heat up the machine by having it run for 10 minutes. This is done with <em>Alt-C-5</em></p>

<p>The first run will be a <strong>dry run</strong>. We put the z axis higher than it should be. This way the machine is going to mill in the air so we can make sure the path looks ok.</p>

<p>When we are done, we set the z axis well again and click <em>Cut Part</em>.</p>

<p>We keep the index on the space bar to interrupt the process if anything goes wrong.</p>

<p>When we are done, we have a block of styrofoam where the top layer has been totally removed.

<p><strong>Second assignment</strong>: make something big</p>

<p>Our machine is pretty small and we only had 2 days in the lab because of the confinement rules in France. So we made something small.</p>

<p>We made a small puzzle piece. We used a gap of 0.1 mm and couldn’t piece them together.</p>

<p>The first problem we had is that the milling went too far down.
This dug too far down in the tabs, and as a result, the piece flew off.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/08-17-bad-tabs.gif" alt="alt text" title="bad tabs" /></p>

<p>We used 0.2 mm and it worked but it was way too tight.
0.3 mm was the perfect size.

<p><strong>Hints for next time</strong></p>

<p>The milling was very slow. Next time we mill into styrofoam, we can have a very small overlap, maybe 0.2. This way the milling can go faster</p>
